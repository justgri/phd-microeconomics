        "I would like to pause for a moment and alert you to the fact that many economists
            have strong and conflicting views about what economic theory is. Some
            see it as a *set of theories* about the interaction between individuals in
            economic situations, theories that can be tested. Others see it as a *bag
            of tools* to be used by economists. Many see it as a *lens* through which
            academic economists view the world. <br>
            My own view may disappoint those of you who have come to this
            course with practical motives. In my view, economic theory is ‚Äùjust‚Äù an
            arena for the *investigation of concepts* we use in thinking about real-life
            economic situations. What makes a theoretical model into an ‚Äúeconomic
            model‚Äù is that the concepts are taken from real-life reasoning about economic
            issues. Through the investigation of these concepts, we hope to
            better able to understand reality, and the models provide a language
            that enables us to think about economic interactions in a systematic
            way. However, I do not view economic models as an attempt to describe
            the world, to provide tools for predicting the future or to prescribe how
            people should behave. I object to looking for ultimate truth in economic
            theory, and I do not expect it to be the foundation for any policy recommendations.
            Nothing is ‚Äúholy‚Äù in economic theory ‚Äì it is the creation
            of people like yourself."

        1. **Rational Choice Theory** <br>
        A preference relation $\succeq$ is rational if it's complete and transitive.<br>
        Completeness implies reflexivity. <br>
        
        2. **Utility Representation** <br>
        $u: X \to \mathbb{R}$ represents $\succeq$, if for all $x, y \in X$, $x \succeq y iff u(x) \geq u(y)$ <br>
        $\succeq$ can be represented by $u$ if and only if it is rational. <br>
        If $X = \mathbb{R}^L_+$ and $\succeq$ is rational and continuous, then $\exists u$ (continuous) that represents $\succeq$<br>

        3. **WARP and Axioms $\alpha$ and $\beta$** <br>
        WARP is necessary but not sufficient for rationality. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ together imply WARP and vice-versa. <br>
        WARP: if $x, y \in B_1 \cap B_2$ and if $x \in C(B_1)$, $y \in C(B_2)$, then it must be the case that $x \in C(B_2)$. <br>
        $\alpha$ (aka Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives): if $x$ chosen from a subset, then it must be chosen from the superset.<br>
        $\beta$: if $x, y$ are chosen from a subset and $y$ is chosen from a superset, then $x$ must be chosen from the superset.<br>

        4. **Duality of utility maximization and expenditure minimization** <br>
        If $u$ is continous and represents a locally nonsatiated $\succeq$, then $x^*$ that solves UMP also solves EMP and vice-versa.<br>
        Solving UMP gives the Walrasian (or Marshallian) demand and solving EMP gives the Hicksian demand. <br>
        If $x(p, w)$ is the Walrasian demand function, then:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. $p \cdot x(p, w) = w$<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. $x(p, w)$ is homogeneous of degree 0 in $(p, w)$ <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. If $\succeq$ is convex (so $u$ is quasiconcave), $x(p,w)$ is a convex set. If $\succeq$ is strictly convex (so $u$ is strictly quasiconcave), $x(p,w)$ is single-valued.
                    
        5. **General equilibrium** <br>
        Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First: competitive equilibrium is Pareto-efficient. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second: for any Pareto-efficient allocation $(x^*, y^*), \exists p \neq 0$, s.t., $(x^*, y^*, p)$ is a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers.<br>
        Edgeworth box. <br>  
        
        6. **Comparative statics**<br>
        Compensating variation and equivalent variation. <br>
        Consumer surplus. <br>

        7. **Optimization with Lagrange and Kuhn-Tucker** <br>

        8. **Weierstrass Theorem** <br>
        Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be compact, and let $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous. Then $f$ attains a maximum and a minimum on $X$,<br>
        i.e., there exists points $z_1$, $z_2 \in X$ such that $f(z_1) \leq f(x) \leq f(z_2)$ for all $x \in X$. <br> 

        9. **Choice Under Uncertainty** <br>
        Independence axiom. <br>
        Linearity of vNM expected utility: $U(L)= \sum_{n=1}^N p_n u_n$, where $u_n$ are Bernoulli utilities  <br>
        Certainty equivalent, risk premium, and probability premium.
