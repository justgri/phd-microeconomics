        "I would like to pause for a moment and alert you to the fact that many economists
            have strong and conflicting views about what economic theory is. Some
            see it as a *set of theories* about the interaction between individuals in
            economic situations, theories that can be tested. Others see it as a *bag
            of tools* to be used by economists. Many see it as a *lens* through which
            academic economists view the world. <br>
            My own view may disappoint those of you who have come to this
            course with practical motives. In my view, economic theory is ‚Äùjust‚Äù an
            arena for the *investigation of concepts* we use in thinking about real-life
            economic situations. What makes a theoretical model into an ‚Äúeconomic
            model‚Äù is that the concepts are taken from real-life reasoning about economic
            issues. Through the investigation of these concepts, we hope to
            better able to understand reality, and the models provide a language
            that enables us to think about economic interactions in a systematic
            way. However, I do not view economic models as an attempt to describe
            the world, to provide tools for predicting the future or to prescribe how
            people should behave. I object to looking for ultimate truth in economic
            theory, and I do not expect it to be the foundation for any policy recommendations.
            Nothing is ‚Äúholy‚Äù in economic theory ‚Äì it is the creation
            of people like yourself."
