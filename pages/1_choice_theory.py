            Building this algorithm definitely helped me internalize WARP for life. Below is my way of converting math into code.<br>
            WARP states that if $x, y \in B_1 \cap B_2$ and if $x \in C(B_1)$, $y \in C(B_2)$, then it must be the case that $x \in C(B_2)$. <br>
            1. Observe that WARP only applies to bundles that contain both $x$ and $y$.<br>
            2. Thus it also requires a pairwise comparison of each two items, $x$ and $y$, e.g., Apple and Banana, Apple and Mango, etc.
            (maybe there was a more efficient way?)<br>
            3. Then for each pair of bundles apply the following:<br>
            a. Filter shown bundles to only those that contain both $x$ and $y$.<br>
            b. Filter choices from these bundles into two lists, one where $x$ was chosen and one where $y$ was chosen separately.<br>
            c. For WARP to hold, either $x$ or $y$ or both must be chosen in all relevant bundles.
            Therefore, if either of the lists is empty or if both lists are same length, then WARP is not violated.<br>
            d. If (c.) doesn't hold, then filter through the relevant bundles to pick two bundles $A$ and $B$
            and their choices to proof WARP violation in text.<br>
